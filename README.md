### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alistair Young, a hacker (primarily working with C# and python, along with home automation using CircuitPython and Arduino), maker, and science fiction writer originally from the UK, but now of Wichita, KS.

[![Alistair's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=cerebrate&show_icons=true)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

Below, you'll find examples of both aspects of my work in the form of recent releases and fiction pieces from my blog, but most popular among my work, you'll find:

#### :desktop_computer: This software

* [genie](https://github.com/arkane-systems/genie) - run systemd under WSL 2
* [Mouse Jiggler](https://github.com/cerebrate/mousejiggler) - exactly what it says on the tin

#### :books: And these books...

* [Vignettes of the Star Empire](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A2X4QQO/) (Tales of the Associated Worlds #1)
* [The Core War and Other Stories](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VSM9NNE/) (Tales of the Associated Worlds #2)

I hope you enjoy whichever you came here for! Incidentally, I also do freelance development from time to time; feel free to contact me (at avatar@arkane-systems.net) if you need some work done!
